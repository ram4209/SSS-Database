This project delves into the process of data normalization, focusing on structuring the contents of an application within the Social Security System. The Social Security System functions as a vital government agency, offering social insurance, retirement benefits, and loans to Filipino employees and private sector workers. The application form encompasses various fields, including personal details, beneficiaries information, and business histories.

Through eliminating and identifying attributes, group members simplified the application form to establish data normalization and interconnect the entities effectively. This normalization process aims to streamline the application form, thereby enhancing the efficiency and efficacy of acquiring SSS benefits. Specifically targeting a range of entities, from the personal information of applicants to the details pertaining to their businesses, the project seeks to optimize the application process for a seamless user experience.

Business Rule:
1. An applicant must have one or more beneficiaries
2. The applicant must provide accurate contact information for communication regarding their application status
3. All submitted documents must be valid and up-to-date for verification purposes
4. The hierarchy of beneficiaries may or may not be followed as designated by the applicant, allowing for flexibility in the beneficiary structure.
5. Each applicant may only submit one application, as the Social Security number assigned to them is a lifetime identifier.
6. Non-working individuals can obtain a Social Security number provided they are at least 15 years old.
